## Introduction

This is a small project in its initial stages that is intended to be a small 
streaming platform that people can listen to music, or upload their own.

## About the project

The project uses Next.js, Tailwind for styling, and custom components made with React.
It is intended to be a fully responsive app and should adapt to whatever screen size
it is run on.

It is currently styled to have a similar aesthetic to Spotify.

## Next steps

The next steps for this project is to hook up the database tables that I have created with Supabase
and allow for users to upload and listen to music. I will also be implenting an authentification system,
probably using Clerk.js, and payment methods using Stripe.

## Running the project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.
